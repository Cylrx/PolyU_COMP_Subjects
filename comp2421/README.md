- **Recommendation:** Compulsory
- **Difficulty:** Medium
  
## 💭 Comments:
- Despite common perceptions, [Prof. Zhou Kai](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~kaizhou/)'s lectures are informative and well-structured imo. He is also responsive to my questions and clarifies doubts effectively.
- The course content is extensive, comparable to or exceeding COMP2411, but individual concepts are relatively straightforward. Taking thorough notes and ensuring comprehension of each topic is essential for success.
- I found this course particularly engaging, though it might just be influenced by it being my first exposure to low-level concepts.
