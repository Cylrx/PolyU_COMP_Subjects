# COMP4432 Machine Learning

- **Personal Rating:** 8.5/10
- **Final Grade:** A+
- **Difficulty**: Medium (Easy if you have prior knowledge)
- **Recommendation**: Highly recommend for those with some ML background

# 💭 Comments:
- High grades are achievable (I got A+ despite missing most quizzes, which cost me ~10 marks deduction)
- Lecture slides skipped some pre-requisites. Solution: ask AI.
- Projects can be highly engaging and rewarding (see below).
