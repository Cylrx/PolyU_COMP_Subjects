# COMP1002 Computational Thinking and Problem Solving

- **Personal Rating:** 7/10
- **Final Grade:** A
- **Recommendation:** Compulsory
- **Difficulty:** Easy

## üí≠ Comments:
- For programming beginners: Practice contest style problems to prepare for DomJudge assessments (see below)
- High grades (A/A+) are easily achievable (I got acceptable grades despite major mark deduction from missing project deadline)

## üìö Additional Resources:
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) - Problems come with pre-written code structure (class/method templates). Complete beginners may miss learning basic syntax like input/output handling
- [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) - Better for complete beginners as you write everything from scratch, including basic program structure and I/O
