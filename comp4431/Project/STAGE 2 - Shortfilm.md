**INTRODUCTION**

_Synopsis_

In 2062, humanity's leap into AGI splits the world apart. LibreAI, an open-source initiative advocating transparency and collaborative AI safeguards, sees its laboratories burned to the ground during anti-tech riots. Amid the turmoil, tech conglomerate Oblivix Inc. exploits public panic to push through laws monopolizing AI under the guise of "safety." As society applauds LibreAI's downfall, Oblivix's master plan silently initiates.

_Director's Statement_

This narrative mirrors real-world battles over AI governance, particularly recent regulatory pushes by organizations like OpenAI. Through Oblivix's calculated power grab, we interrogate how corporations weaponize existential fears to monopolize progress. The true crisis emerges not from rogue algorithms, but from humanity surrendering its future to boardroom oligarchs.
