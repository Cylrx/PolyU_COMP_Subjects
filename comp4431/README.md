# COMP4431 Artificial Intelligence

- **Personal Rating:** 6.5/10
- **Final Grade:** A
- **Recommendation:** Fluff course (水课，但好拿分)
- **Difficulty:** Easy

## 💭 Comments:

- **On the Concepts**: The curriculum covers fundamental ML principles but doesn't go deep into complex theory. The difficulty peaks with topics like Alpha-beta pruning, which ultimately wasn't tested on our final. You shouldn't need to spend much effort revising materials. 
- **On the Workload**: The primary assignment is creating an AI-themed video, which accounts for a major portion of the workload. This was a highlight for me as I enjoy creative projects. However, if you're looking for a class heavy on technical problem-solving or coding, be aware that the focus here is different.
