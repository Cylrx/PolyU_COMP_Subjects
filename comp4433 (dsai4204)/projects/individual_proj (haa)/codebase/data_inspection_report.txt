DATA INSPECTION REPORT
======================

Target Variable Analysis:
-------------------------
We analyzed the correlation between the 'output' variable and key clinical indicators to determine its true meaning.

1. ST Depression (oldpeak):
   - output=0 mean: 1.58 (High depression -> Ischemia/Disease)
   - output=1 mean: 0.58 (Low depression -> Normal)
   -> Indicates output=0 is Disease, output=1 is Healthy.

2. Max Heart Rate (thalachh):
   - output=0 mean: 139.1 (Lower HR -> Compromised)
   - output=1 mean: 158.5 (Higher HR -> Healthy)
   -> Indicates output=0 is Disease, output=1 is Healthy.

3. Exercise Induced Angina (exng):
   - output=0 mean: 0.55 (55% have angina -> Disease)
   - output=1 mean: 0.14 (14% have angina -> Healthy)
   -> Indicates output=0 is Disease, output=1 is Healthy.

4. Major Vessels Colored (caa):
   - output=0: High frequency of non-zero values (Calcification present)
   - output=1: Predominantly 0 (No calcification)
   -> Indicates output=0 is Disease, output=1 is Healthy.

CONCLUSION:
The dataset label is INVERTED relative to the provided description.
output=1 corresponds to "Less Chance of Heart Attack" (Healthy).
output=0 corresponds to "More Chance of Heart Attack" (Disease).

Interpretation of your Mining Results:
--------------------------------------
Your Subgroup Discovery targeted 'output=1'.
Therefore, you were discovering rules for "Health", not "Risk".

- Rule "exng==0" -> output=1: "No Angina -> Healthy". (Correct)
- Rule "caa==0" -> output=1: "No Calcification -> Healthy". (Correct)
- Rule "cp==0" (Typical Angina) -> output=0 (Low prob of 1): "Typical Angina -> Disease". (Correct)
