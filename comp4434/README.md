## üí≠ Comments:
- Relatively light workload overall
- Start group project early as deep learning model training can take time
- Lenient grading (easy to argue marks back)
- Final exam questions follow a consistent pattern; practicing past papers is sufficient to perform well
- Prof. Huang Xiao is very responsive to messages

## üìö Additional Resources:
- If GPU resources are insufficient for the group project, consider https://www.autodl.com/, the cloud platform I used.
