--- THE ALGORITHM ---

1. Euler Sieve
 - Implements Euler Sieve up to a predetermined limit
 - Utilizes custom-implemented bitset to mark non-primes, reducing memory usage
 - Employs 2-3-5 factorization to skip multiples of 2,3,5, enhancing constant time efficiency

2. Store Primes
 - Java has inherent restrictions when declaring large arrays due to memory fragmentation
 - Therefore, primes are stored in a 2D array, with each row holding S = 2^20 primes
 - Memory occupied by Euler Sieve is freed
 - 2D array is expanded to JVM's maximum allowable size

3. Eratosthenes Sieve
 - Continues sieving from where Euler Sieve ended
 - Sieves numbers in blocks of size S = 2^20
 - For each block: 
	- Initializes bitset to mark non-primes (Similar to Euler Sieve)
	- Applies 2-3-5 wheel factorization to improve efficiency
	- Stores primes if additional space remains from STEP 2
	- Writes discovered primes to the file

Additional Implementation Details for Efficiency: 
- Pierre Dusart's bounds on the prime-counting function and the nth prime number are used for tighter approximation of required array size
- Binary Search is used to find the maximum range for sieving given memory constraints (Solves the constraint equation: x + 8x / lnx < MEMORY_LIMIT)


--- THEORETICAL ANALYSIS ---

Let n = the limit the algorithm sieves up to

Time Complexity: 

 - Euler Sieve phase: O(n) 
 - Block Sieve phase: O(n log log n)

 - When n < 4e9, Euler Sieve predominantly determines runtime, thus O(n) dominates
 - When n > 4e9, Eratosthenes Sieve gradually becomes dominant, thus O(n log log n) 


Memory Complexity: 

When n < 4e9 (Euler Sieve): 
 - Storing prime numbers: O(π(n)), where π is the prime-counting function
 - Marking prime numbers: O(n/B), where B = 64
 - π(n) represents the prime-counting function 
 - B equals 32 for 32-bit computers; 64 for 64-bit computers

 - Explanation: 
	- All discovered prime numbers are stored for Euler Sieve. Therefore, memory usage equals the count of prime numbers within n, given by the prime-counting function π(n). While π(n) is sometimes approximated as n/ln(n), more precise bounds are used in this implementation
	- Since bitset is implemented, memory usage for marking n numbers as prime or non-prime is divided by 32 or 64 depending on the system architecture


When n > 4e9 (Block Sieve): 
 - Storing prime numbers: O(π(√n))
 - Marking prime numbers: O(BLOCK_SIZE/B) = O(1), as both BLOCK_SIZE and B are constants

 - Explanation: 
	- To sieve up to n, only prime numbers up to √n need storage. Therefore, required memory is π(√n)
	- Similar to Euler's Sieve, but since sieving occurs in blocks, memory requirement remains constant at BLOCK_SIZE/32 or 64


Theoretical Limit: 

Assuming 4GB of RAM, 
 - Maximum storable prime numbers: 4GB/8Byte = 5e8
 - Since the nth prime number p_n ∼ n ln n
 - Therefore, the 500,000,000th prime number ≈ 5e8 * ln(5e8) ≈ 1e10
 - Consequently, maximum achievable sieve limit ≈ (1e10)² = 1e20
