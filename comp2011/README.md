# COMP2011 Data Structure

- **Personal Rating:** 7/10
- **Final Grade:** A+
- **Difficulty**: Hard (Easy ~ Medium for those with competitive programming experience)
- **Recommendation**: Compulsory
  
**üí≠ Comments:**
- Course design has some discouraging aspects for algorithm beginners:
  + Assignment policy penalizes citing references, which discourages learning from external resources
  + Homework problems are too challenging and near impossible for beginners to solve independently, **yet** using references is discouraged

**üìö Additional Resources:**
- [OI Wiki](https://oi-wiki.org/ds/): reference material for all kinds of algorithms / data structures
- [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com):
  - For practicing specific algorithms / data structures.
  - Aim for **classic problems** (e.g., inversion pair w/ mergesort) if you wish to tackle exam bonus questions

Note: Some resources may be in Chinese/English
