# COMP2432 Operating System

- **Personal Rating:** 3/10
- **Final Grade:** A-
- **Recommendation:** Compulsory
- **Difficulty:** Easy ~ Medium

## 💭 Comments:
-   **Flawed Assessments:** Exam questions are often highly ambiguous or test on material **never mentioned in the lectures**. When this was raised, the instructor's response was that students should have been able to "just guess" the answers.

-   **Hostility Towards Feedback:** Raising valid concerns can lead to punitive action. I personally experienced this twice:
    1.  When I inquired about several poorly defined midterm questions, my concerns were dismissed. Instead, the instructor re-examined unrelated problems on my paper and retroactively lowered my score （**倒扣分**）, using the pretext of correcting "lenient grading"—a standard he had already admitted was applied to the entire class.
    2.  When my group pointed out a clear error in the **official project solution** that affected the entire class, we were threatened with a **10+ point grade reduction** for bringing it up.

Due to this conduct, this was unequivocally the worst course experience I have had at PolyU.
